# Zoom

## For zooming...

Simple 'wrap' of ScrollableFOV plugin, all we've done is;
1. Make a config GUI for rebinding of zoom key.
2. Remove fov value from notifying the user.
3. Added a config checkbox for 'Zoom Lock', where a user can choose to double tap the Zoom key to lock the Zoom. (By Default, ON)

Credits go to Math0424 for creating ScrollableFOV.
